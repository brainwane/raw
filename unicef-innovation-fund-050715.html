Chis Fabian
    <p>Hi everybody!</p>

    <p>Thank you for joining us. It is great to have a triple-y sold out event.</p>


    <P>
    My name is Chris Fabian, I co-lead innovation unit. We're joined by
    colleagues from our Regional labs.
    </P>


    <P>
    Our Executive Director, Tony Lake, on a discussion.
    </P>


Tony
    <p>What a difference it is already making!</p>

    <p>I took off my necktie, expecting to become cool, but not so much ;)</p>

    <p>
    We're celebrating here, not only innovations, but the <em>results</em> of
    the innovations.
    </p>

    <p>
    In terms of meeting the purposes of why we emphasize it; reaching
    disadvantaged children. The results are starting to come in in Uganda, so
    far, almost 1.5M who's births have been registered. Thanks to Shirad(sp),
    ureport has registered well over 100K kids as ureporters, who are
    reporting on events in their community. We have 700K in over 14 countries
    reporting now. It has huge implications in allowing youth to report. The
    development community then doesn't tell them, they tell the development
    community, democratizing development in ways we haven't been before.
    </p>

    <p>
    Innovations help us find if textbooks, in EDUtrac. Toilets, and teachers,
    whether they are working (both) *laughs*.
    </p>

    <p>
    Including kids in geographic areas, disabilities, indigenous areas, and I
    could go on and on.
    </p>


    <p>
    The global innovation center, and innovation fund are at the heart of
    this. They will help us reach many more. The center in Nairobi, will be a
    center where we can risk failure--something I will come back to later--and
    the 5 core sponsors, the Government of Korea, Phillips Foundation, and
    UNICEF CA/UK/US. The center and fund work hand in hand, in that the center
    is the beginning of the stream. As we incubate and scale things, the fund
    helps. Then the center helps again to connect different groups and
    countries.
    </p>

    <p>
    It all works hand-in-hand. The founding members, the Government of
    Denmark, and Disney/Lucas Films.
    </p>

    <p>
    All of you are part of this. All of you are cool. All of you are making a
    difference. You won't know which kids you will have helped, but you should
    know there are hundreds of thousands and Millions of kids you are helping.
    </p>


    <p>
    I have a list of questions here, and you each have 2 minutes. Let me
    begin--we have people with first-hand experience. Caroline Berevra(sp),
    we've had some interesting talks already.
    </p>

    <p>
    Q: Why are youth partnerships so important, what impact can they have?
    </p>

Caroline

    <p>
    A: Activists. When we talk about 700K reporters in 14 countries. We're not
    just talking about reporters, but individuals. At 15, I participated in the
    UN general assembly session on children. It helped make me the person I am
    today. We have over 250K users. I asked at a girl at the Summit, and she
    said the platform helped her to empower other girls, join clubs, and be
    more meaningful in her community. I spoke to a boy, he said his best
    experience was access to info. During Ebola, he got info that was
    life-changing via SMS. The potential is enormous... you can ignore 10, or
    100 kids, but a billion, you cannot.
    </p>

Tony

    <P>
    There was an emphasis on how we worked with partners. I'd be curious as to
    why you supported the center?
    </P>


Korea(name)

    <P>
    I'm happy to be here representing the public sector in republic of Korea.
    As you know, Korea's success story is a story of innovation by education,
    and by entrepreneurship. This is an example of what investing in next
    generation is. We are talking about post 2015 development. Global
    sustainable development goal will be announced in September. Dignity, and
    Justice are part of that.
    </P>

    <P>
    Creating solidarity, we surcharge $1 for every plane ticket from Korea to
    overseas, which can be a resource to help other countries, and brings in
    about $15M/year. Samsung, and other electronics companies, will support
    the '1000 Days project' to help the first part of a child's life. Samsung
    electronics will scale from Rwanda to Uganda, and other countries. WE can
    expand our assistance. We want to do job training, and global citizenship
    education. There is a saying that You can count the seeds in an apple, but
    you cannot count the apples in a seed. We're hoping to build 10's of
    millions of apples in the future.
    </P>

    <P>
    Public/private/media, all will benefit. This is what this global center is
    about.
    </P>

Tony
    <p>what we do with Children today will decide fate of SDGs.</p>

    <p>Data Science within Mexico presidency's office.</p>

    <p>Q: Why is real-time data so important?</p>

    <P>
    A: Generating public policy is slow and costly. Policy that works is harder.
    IT is hard for governments to implement policy. It is sometimes because of
    lack of information, and ability to test out if it is working. We may be
    perpetrating policy that doesn't work, you don't know until many years after
    it has happened. Real-time data is what we can do.
    </P>

    <P>
    We can focus to analyze a situation more concisely. We can see and implement a
    decision. After you implement, you can see how it works. If it is working, you
    can improve and scale it up.
    </P>

    <P>
    In the case of maternal mortality rates, it is hard to tackle because we don't
    see the data as it is happening. When we get the data, it is too late. With
    RapidPro. We can see the most vulnerable and at risk women. We can get data,
    and be there as the problem arises, before it is too late. This is a problem
    that plagues Mexico,and the rest of the world.
    </P>


Tony

    <P>
    You can't manage innovations unless you get real-time info on what is
    working or isn't. Good point.
    </P>

    <p>David Morley, Rajesh Ananden(sp). Realtime is at the heart of our innovations.</p>

<p>Q: Why are you taking the lead, with the UK, on support for these efforts?</p>

<p>
A: Canadian committee believes so much that all the gains made in the last
generation, we're in the middle of a child survival revolution. To keep them
moving, we have to find new ways. I've heard you say many times "we've done
the easy pats, and now things are going to get difficult." To reach the
children that are really hard to reach, we have to innovate. I've been
fortunate to see them working. You mentioned birth registration, I was in
Uganda, and saw the electronic registration taking place. I was convinced
beyond, when a father was there getting registered for his passport for
protection. "My daughter's name is Gift..." he said.
</p>


<p>
As the US fund, we're here thanks to our partners that believe in this work,
   at the Walt Disney company. Because of their belief in creativity in every
   child. Thanks to GE and Phizer, who fund many projects. Thanks to Google who
   believe in the power of information in the hands of all of us. From silicon
   valley to silicon alley, they've turned artisans into retailers, and drivers
   into taxi services. That is what UNICEF innovation is doing. We've turned
   volunteers into supply chain managers. We've taken rural Ugandan, who has a
   feature phone, and turned them into an agent of change to abolish corporal
   punishments. That is the privilege we get to be a part of that.
   </p>


   <p>
   Q: If you are going to be an entrepreneur, if you are going to be the first
   Woman CEO in Afghanistan , you are taking a risk. One answer we got was, the
   problem of the culture in the UN, which isn't risk taking. I'm curious what
   you've learned, and how you manage risk?
   </p>

   <p>
   A: Conflict is still happening. The government is not influenced by entirety
   of country. Security and insurance are a measures of the problem. There can be
   dangers that destroy businesses. Risks are sometimes in the category. The
   software of the Afgan businesses are not ready for the changes. I started my
   business to get new technology into the country. I faced problems with
   conservative people. I changed my business, and started using social media.
   That changed my personal/business life, and we need these tools to empower
   other women. We connected over 55K students. They learned about IT, and became
   digital citizens. They are not thinking about gender/color, they don't need a
   visa, they can be connected, an communicate. Risk allowed us to find other
   innovation. We have ll the business that has to be aware of, they can be
   prepared. They can take action appropriately after that.
   </p>

    <p>A great illustration of the multiplier effect.</p>

<p>Q:  Phillips foundation/UNICEF UK. You were core sponsors. What led you to
       be among them?</p>

UK

    <P>Thanks for the opportunity, it was obvious to us. We're 120 year
    old company, you may know us for CDs and TVs. But we were lighting up
    the forbidden city, and we're in Beijing with X-ray machines. We have
    the most sophisticated non-invasive diagnostic tools. We have portable
    ultrasounds in Africa. I would say I have the best job in Philips,
    where I get to harness these innovations. This is an opportunity to be
    innovative, impactful, and caring.</P>

    It's great to be here on UK election Day. The polls close in about 20
    mins. I'm missing the buzz of that, because I believe deeply in this--the
    power of innovation to make a difference in the lives of children. UNICEF
    has been at the forefront for decades. When I first started 16 years ago,
    I asked one of my colleagues, how does it work? 
    </p>

    <blockqoute>Innovate, Demonstrate, replicate, advocate.</blockqoute> 

    <p>
    I've followed that ever since. You can't do it just once, you gotta do it
    all the time. When I heard, I jumped at the chance. I want to be at the
    heart of it. In UNICEF UK, it is part of our culture, and why we are
    successful. We've done a lot of things which we think are innovative that
    have been picked up. We had a parallel version of the G8 for kids in
    Germany. We've been at the forefront of mobile fundraising. RapidFTR is
    amazing tool to help children to reunite in difficult humanitarian
    situations.
    </p>

    <p>
    Fundraising innovation, we've been looking hard at how to harness the
    carbon market to get access to energy. There are many ways we can look for
    ways to finance the coming development goals. We're keen to bring new
    partners to the table, so we can have 20 people on this stage, helping to
    help children.

Prof. Anil Gupta. I really enjoyed hearing about the honeybee network.
We're working hard in UNICEF in the way of horizontal network building.
What were key factors in building it?
</p>

<P>
A: We were poor in the material, but not in mind. The world has changed over
the last 25 years. We've put over 200,000 ideas from our country and other
districts in our country. If you give voice to common people, they will share
their ideas generally. Much more knowledge exists in Open Source. We realized
that we know a great deal about micro-finance, but not micro-venture finance.
The future transformation will happen through this transformation. To be able
to invest risk-capital. We have been working on the innovation for common
people and children. The president has an innovation scholar in residence.
They stay as a guest. Honeybee network shows grassroots innovation. 
</P>

<blockquote>Children are not a sink of resources, but a source of
innovation.</blockquote>

Mission of Denmark. At the board meeting, we identified factors like
"measuring, and data, risk taking, but also financing. Denmark has played a
leading role for providing not only financing, but the flexibility. How did
you come to the decision to be a leader?
</P>

<P>
Denmark as a small country has lived on innovation. This was extremely
interesting. I was registered as an unaccompanied diplomat at FTR. We have
worked a few times with innovation, and with UN programs and funds, we wanted
to get out of our comfort zone, for the partners out there. I've always
considered aid as risk-winning capital. It isn't that we don't want to
measure, but it is risk-leaning. We have to do it when it comes to find ways
to more effectively reach out to the young. WE agreed that we'd increase our
contribution. WE agreed to contribute to the fund. We are very happy to see
the results. When it comes to financing, the post 2015 agenda, we'll discuss
our next steps. Getting private capital involved. The folks who can solve the
problems of the world can also make the money. It is a win-win. We heard about
a micro-venture program in Jordan, where there are $5K investment.
Risk-winning capital. We need to look into the financing part.
</P>


Tony

    <p>
    I'm thinking bout where were we a few years ago. If we all take the energy
    you have in this room, and take it think of where we're going in a few
    years from now. Thank you all.
    </p>


<p>
All of us can relate that our parents have warned us about beware the company
you keep. We're privileged to keep company like his, willing to take risks,
provide flexible financing, thought leadership, labs, all towards one aim: to
take something from startup to scale-up, to benefit children. None of this
cool stuff out there, would be possible without people like this walking the
journey with us. It isn't only the financing but the passion and advocacy.
You'll leave here hopefully an advocate of the work the partners are doing
around innovation. We'd like to invite each of our core partners to sign a
block. Each of these blocks represent the pieces of the contributions each
organization makes. The structure is not done or finished, and we hope others
will come on board. A year from now, if we had to go through this again, to
tell you how many more people are involved, we can talk about how we went from
a startup to today. It will be even more scaled up and more partners here.
We're going to take a number of photos, and then we invite you to get hands-on
with the projects, and join us for a reception.
</p>
